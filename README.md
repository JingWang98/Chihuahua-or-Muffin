# Chihuahua-or-Muffin
For my exam of Statistical Methods for Machine Learning, I decided to train a neural network for the binary classification of muffins and chihuahuas using Keras library.
We are asked to:
experiment with different network architectures (at least 3) and training hyperparameters,
use 5-fold cross validation to compute the risk estimates,
discuss the obtained results, documenting the influence of the choice of the network architecture and the tuning of the hyperparameters on the final cross-validated risk estimate.
The reported cross-validated estimates must be computed according to the zero-one loss.
